          <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
<p>Over the last few months, we have been researching and collectinged
delinked articles data from different media outlets across Europe. Our
focus was to obtain as  much data as possible but we had some drawbacks.
In some cases, the media outlet did not know that Google had  notified
them  about an article  being deindexed from its search engine, in
others, this kind of information was not collected or if collected, they
would not share their data with us.</p>
<p>Once a data sample had been built, we categorized all delinked articles
depending on the topic they covered. We used this the following 6
categories: Business, for stories in which their main actors moved
around an economic background;, Crime, for stories that covered any sort
of illegal behavior like assaults, fraud, etc. Personal for private
persons and finally, Politics, Extremism and Youth. </p>
<p><img src="/images/graph-delinked_articles.png" /></p>
<p>We cannot provide personalized stories as it would go against the right
to be forgotten but here we present the main results of the data
analysis.</p>
<p>We reached the conclusion that articles with an economic angle related
to business people or having to do with fraud, were the ones most
deindexed by Google in the media analyzed. Almost a third of the pages
removed from Der Spiegel (Germany), der Standard.at (Austria) and El
Confidencial (Spain)  were related to business. This is a higher
percentage compared to UK media. Delfi, a Baltic media group,
was hardly affected by delinks of business-related articles, despite Estonia being
the country with the highest number of requests per capita.</p>
<p>The personal category, where a private person is the main focus of
the story, was part of half the stories affected on the Helsingin Sanomat (Finland) and Delfi.
The UK’s BBC and the Telegraph as well as
Der Standard (Austria) and El Confidencial (Spain) had a 30%
share of personal articles. Der Spiegel (Germany) had almost 20%, the lowest of
the analysed media in this category. </p>
<p>A surprising finding was that a lot of deindexed stories  were related
to crime. This is particularly true  for the UK media we
have analyzed, where half the stories on the BBC are focused on this
category.  In some of these stories, one can reasonably guess who
requested that the
article should be deindexed from search results. In most cases, it is
the alleged criminal once the charges have been withdrawn, but this is
not always the case.</p>
<p>As far as Politics goes its influence is stronger in
the Delfi and Helsingin than in any other media outlets, with almost
half of the delinked stories having a political aspect. Delinked stories
on the topic of extremism are only prevalent in Der Standard and
El Confidencial.</p>
<p>Finally, youth is a less prevalent topic than expected in deindexed
stories. Youngsters and millenials are underrepresented in the media
despite belonging to the Internet generation and they only  represent
15% of the deindexed stories in the case of der Standard.at, and less
than 10% in all other cases. </p>
<p>After several months collecting this information, we want to enlarge our
data sample in order to find out more about the decision making process
of the Right to be forgotten. If you are a journalist or a media outlet
and you want to collaborate with this project or share any data related
to the Right to be forgotten, you can write us to this email
